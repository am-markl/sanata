# sanata [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hexacta/sanata.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hexacta/sanata) [![code style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-prettier-ff69b4.svg)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)  
> Web application showing auto generated tweets based on a Markov Chain model of a given Twitter user.

## Development

> Prerequisites: you'll need node and npm installed

If you don't have `yarn` installed, install it:
```
$ npm i -g yarn
```

After cloning the repo, install the dependencies. Inside sanata folder, run:
```
$ yarn install
```

And then run the front-end and back-end with one command:
```
$ yarn start
```

By default this run the front-end at http://localhost:3000/ and the back-end at http://localhost:8080/. Both are watching for changes, so there is no need to re-start it after changes.  


In order to use the twitter api you need an [API key and API secret](https://dev.twitter.com/apps).  
Once you have them, create a `.env` file inside the `server` folder, like this:
```
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=yourkey
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=yoursecret
#MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/sanata
```

### Database

If you don't specify a `MONGO_URL` in your .env file, Sanata will run with a mocked db. This means that every request will go to the Twitter API without using any cached information from the user.  
So, for most cases you don't need a DB, but if you insist, you have two options: run mongodb with docker or use your own instance.  

If you have docker installed, running this command should be enough:
```
yarn run start:mongo
```
>Don't forget to add (or uncomment) `MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/sanata` in your .env file.
